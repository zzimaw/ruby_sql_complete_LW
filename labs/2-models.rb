# This is a Rails app and we want to load all the files in the app 
# when running this code.  To do so, your current working directory
# should be the top-level directory (i.e. /workspace/your-app/) and then run:
# rails runner labs/2-models.rb

# Lab 2: Models
# - We've added data into the companies table.  Next, we'll add data
#   into the salespeople table.  Follow the steps below to insert and
#   read rows of salesperson data.  Update a row.  Afterwards, display
#   how many rows have been inserted into the salespeople table.
#   Lastly, if you want a challenge, try writing code to display the
#   full name of each salesperson.

# 1a. check out the schema file
# 1b. check out the model file

# 2. insert 1-2 rows in salespeople table.

# count how many rows in salespeople table before inserts
puts "Salespeople: #{Salesperson.all.count}"

salesperson = Salesperson.new
salesperson["first_name"] = "Benjamin"
salesperson["last_name"] = "Block"
salesperson["email"] = "ben@test.com"
salesperson.save

salesperson = Salesperson.new
salesperson["first_name"] = "Brian"
salesperson["last_name"] = "Eng"
salesperson["email"] = "brian@test.com"
salesperson.save

# 3. write code to display how many salespeople rows are in the database

# ---------------------------------
# Salespeople: 2

puts "Salespeople: #{Salesperson.all.count}"

# 4. modify/update column data for a row in the salespeople table.

# find row in salespeople table
ben = Salesperson.find_by({"email" => "ben@test.com"})
# modify/assign new value to row's column(s)
ben["first_name"] = "Ben"
# update the row
ben.save

# puts ben.inspect

# CHALLENGE:
# 5. write code to display each salesperson's full name

# ---------------------------------
# Salespeople: 2
# Ben Block
# Brian Eng

# query for all rows in the salespeople table
salespeople = Salesperson.all
# loop through array of salespeople rows
for salesperson in salespeople
  # read the relevant columns from the salesperson row
  first_name = salesperson["first_name"]
  last_name = salesperson["last_name"]

  # display a string with the relevant columns
  puts "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
end
